## Preparing Traces

The traces used in our experiments are primarily from championships or previous work. Below is the detailed information about obtaining these traces. *They should be manually downloaded.* 

We have archived traces that are currently unavailable, or require conversion, or are generated by us:\

### Main Traces
- **SPEC06 and SPEC17 traces.** Available from DPC-3 (https://dpc3.compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/).
- **PARSEC and Ligra traces.** Originally from Pythia (not available now), we have archived a copy of our used traces.
- **CloudSuite traces.** Available from CRC-2 (https://crc2.ece.tamu.edu/).

### More Traces
- **GAP traces** (only used in supplementary experiments). Archived.
- **QMM traces** (only used in supplementary experiments). Archived. The original traces are also available, but they need to be converted manually. 

*All traces should be placed directly in the trace directory `$GAZE_HOME/traces`.*

Run the following command to check if the required traces are ready.

```bash
cd $GAZE_HOME/scripts   
python trace_check.py
```

The main experiments will utilize a total of 201 traces from SPEC06, SPEC17, PARSEC, Ligra, and CloudSuite benchmark suites. In addition to these traces, the supplementary experiments will additionally include GAP and QMM traces.
